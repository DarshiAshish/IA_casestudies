<h1>Text Classification</h1>
<p>Text classification is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to categorize text data into predefined labels based on its content. This is useful for organizing and sorting large volumes of text data.</p>

<h2>How to Do It:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Define Categories:</strong> Determine the categories you want to classify text into.</li>
    <li><strong>Train a Model:</strong> Use machine learning algorithms to train a model on labeled data.</li>
    <li><strong>Classify Text:</strong> Apply the trained model to new text data to classify it into the predefined categories.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ex: Classifying customer feedback into categories like product complaints, service praise, and feature requests. A customer support classifier uses intent classification to automate responses by interpreting user messages and mapping them to predefined replies.</p>
