        <h1>Automatic Text Summarization in NLP</h1>
        <p>Automatic text summarization in NLP condenses long texts while preserving key information. Though less discussed than other ML advancements, it continues to improve, aiding industries like banking, law, and healthcare. There are two main types: Extractive and Abstractive Summarization.</p>

        <div class="summary-section">
            <h2>Extractive Summarization</h2>
            <p>Extractive summarization is a natural language processing technique that involves selecting and extracting key sentences or phrases from a text to create a concise summary. It focuses on identifying the most important parts of the original content without altering the wording.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="summary-section">
            <h2>Abstractive Summarization</h2>
            <p>Abstractive summarization is a natural language processing approach that generates a concise summary by rephrasing and synthesizing the main ideas from the original text. Unlike extractive summarization, which selects existing sentences, abstractive summarization creates new sentences that capture the essence of the content.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Example to Showcase Abstractive and Extractive Summarization</h2>
